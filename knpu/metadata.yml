title:  Gulp! Refreshment for Your Frontend Assets
summary: |

    We all need to minify and combine our CSS and JS files. And with Gulp,
    this is not only easy, but it's actually *fun to do*!
    
    In this tutorial, I'll show you how to setup Gulp in your PHP or Symfony
    project to do a bunch of things:
        
    * Minify CSS and JS files
    * Watch files for changes
    * Combine files
    * Use sourcemaps
    * Publish Font files
    * Have page-specific CSS/JS files
    * Cache-bust with versioning
    
    We'll actually use Laravel's Exlixir as a guide, but make things work
    for any PHP project and learn how we can make Gulp do whatever we need.
    
    Yay!
